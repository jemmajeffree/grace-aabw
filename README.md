# grace-aabw
Code for "GRACE satellite observations of Antarctic Bottom Water transport variability", submitted to JGR: Oceans

Final plots in the paper are created in hr_paper_everything0.ipynb and hr_timeseries.ipynb. default.py contains some shared arguments, which are mostly only used by hr_paper_everything0.ipynb. cosima_grace.py contains the bulk of the functions for heavy lifting

GRACE_validation.ipynb compares GRACE data to in situ records

hr_overturning.ipynb and simulated_GRACE_universal.ipynb demonstrate calculation of AABW transport across transects and averaging of ocean bottom pressure onto the GRACE mascon grid.
